#### Others don’t Exist (317)

I’m not ashamed of feeling this way, as I’ve discovered that’s how everyone feels. What seems to lie behind people’s mutual contempt and indifference, such that they can kill each other like assassins who don’t really feel they’re killing, or like soldiers who don’t think about what they’re doing, is that no one pays heed to the apparently abstruse fact that other people are also living souls.

No, others don’t exist…It’s for me that this heavy-winged sunset lingers, its colors hard and hazy. It’s for me that the great river shimmers below the sunset, even if I can’t see it flow. It’s for me that this square was built overlooking the river, whose waters are now rising. Was the cashier of the tobacco shop buried today in the common grave? Then the sun isn’t setting for him today. But because I think this, and against my will, it has also stopped setting for me.

#### Moments of Respite (319)

I realize now that I’ve failed, and it only surprises me that I didn’t foresee that I was going to fail. What was there in me to suggest I might triumph? I had either the conqueror’s blind force nor the madman’s sure vision. I was lucid and sad, like a cold day.

I’ve lived certain moments of respite in the presence of Nature, moments sculpted out of tender isolation, that will always be like medals for me. In these moments I forgot all of my life’s goals, all of the paths I wanted to follow. An immense spiritual tranquillity fell into the blue lap of my aspirations and allowed me to enjoy being nothing. But I’ve probably never enjoyed an incorruptible moment, free of any underlying spirit of failure and gloom. In all my moments of spiritual liberation there was a formant sorrow, vaguely blooming in gardens beyond the walls of my consciousness, and the scent and the very color of those sad flowers intuitively passed through the stone walls, whose far side (where the roses bloomed) never ceased being a hazy near side in the obscure mystery of who I am, in the drowsiness of my daily existence.


#### To Live is Merely to be Lived (163) 活着只是被活着

Direct experience is an evasion, or hiding place, for those without any imagination. Reading about the risks incurred by a man who hunts tigers, I feel all the risks worth feeling, save the actual physical risk, which wasn’t really worth feeling, for it vanished without a trace.
Men of action are the involuntary slaves of men of reason. The worth of things depends on their interpretation. Certain men make things which other men invest with meaning, bringing them to life. To narrate is to create, while to live is merely to be lived.


#### To possess is to be possessed (271) 占有等同于被占有
The repression of love sheds much more light on its nature than does the actual experience of it. Virginity can be a key to profound understanding. Action has its reward but brings confusion. To possess is to be possessed, and therefore to lose oneself. Only the idea can fathom reality without getting ruined.

> 《看不见的城市》 城市与欲望 之二
> 
> 一直向南走上三天，你就会到达阿纳斯塔西亚。这座城里有许多渠道会聚在一起，空中有许多风筝飞翔。我应该开列一个在这里能买到的上好货品的单子：玛瑙、石华、绿玉髓及各种其他的玉髓；我应该赞美那用陈年的香桃木烤熟的、涂满大量牛至的金黄色的野鸡；还应该提到那些在花园水池里沐浴的女人，据说她们有时还邀请过路者脱掉衣服，跟她们一起在水里追逐嬉戏。不过，所有这些还并非城市的真正本质所在：因为对阿纳斯塔西亚的描述，只能唤起你的一个个欲望，再迫使你把它们压下去，而某天清晨，当你在阿纳斯塔西亚醒来时，所有的欲望会一起萌发，把你包围起来。这座城市对于你好像是全部，没有任何欲望会失落，而你自己也是其中一部分，由于她欣赏你不欣赏的一切，所以你就只好安身于欲望之中，并且感到满足。阿纳斯塔西亚，诡谲的城市，拥有时而恶毒时而善良的力量：你若是每天八个小时切割玛瑙、石华和绿玉髓，你的辛苦就会为欲望塑造出形态，而你的欲望也会为你的劳动塑造出形态；**你以为自己在享受整个阿纳斯塔西亚，其实你只不过是她的奴隶。**
